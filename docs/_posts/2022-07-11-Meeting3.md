Suggestions:

- Doing Django tutorials is not required. One or two video to introduce to Django should be enough. Changes can be easily done by changing all the occurences of variables.
- List all the issues together in a checklist while writing out an issue in the GitHub. Create individual PRs/commits to solve the checklisted tasks in the issue and keep updating it as completed whenever a pushed commit or a merged PR solves that particular task. 
- GitHub issues is a better place to search for an encountered issue in a used repository when compared to Google search. Try to search for the experienced problem on GitHub Issues and create a new issue if that problem is not found.

Tasks:

- [ ] Attempt to fix the FastDDS issue
- [ ] Mount RoboticsAcademy to the Docker Image and try to figure out the changes that are reflected
- [ ] Explore the breaking changes when migrating from ROS1 to ROS2
