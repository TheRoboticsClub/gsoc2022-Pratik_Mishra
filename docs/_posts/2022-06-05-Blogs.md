- Studied the last year GSoC blog at [https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2021-Siddharth_Saha/](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2021-Siddharth_Saha/) and tried to comprehend the deliverables and methodology. 
- Cloned the foxy branch of [https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy)  and ran it. 
- Pulled the Docker image of R.A.D.I. 4.2.0 and ran it.
