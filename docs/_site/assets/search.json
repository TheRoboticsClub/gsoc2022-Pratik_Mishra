This website will serve as my personal blog, in which I will document my journey through the Google Summer of Code 2022.\n\nSynopsis\n\nCurrently most Robotics Academy exercises are based on ROS1 Noetic and Gazebo 11. There are also several prototypes of ROS2 Foxy based exercises that require refinement. The main goal of this project is to migrate several RADI-3 exercises to RADI-4, updating the models of the robots involved in those exercises to their homologous model in ROS2. This will require understanding the complete infrastructure and modifying exercises to use ROS2 communications. In addition, the support for several ROS tools (such as rqt_graph and Rviz) from the corresponding exercise webpages should be implemented (using VNC mainly). New exercises integrating the ROS2 Navigation stack are also welcome, which involve the use of functionalities such as collision avoidance, global path planning, and Multi-robot coordination. ROS2 has put forward several improvements over ROS with changes in middleware and software architecture in many aspects. In this project, we would focus on developing new exercises with ROS2. For more information on ROS2 based exercises, have a look at GSoC 2021 project and corresponding academy exercises 1 and 2. In addition to porting exercises, contributors are also welcome to suggest improvements to the current RADI framework.\n\nMentors\n\n\n  Sakshay Mahna\n  Siddharth Saha (trunc8)\n  Shreyas Gokhale\n\n",
